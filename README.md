# CN_2022_Final

## about this project
In this project we were asked to create a primitive instant messaging system based on communication

The system is made up of a server and a customer
The server initializes itself and "listens"
The server runs on a specific IP server and listens to clients In a particular port known to customers
Each customer can send a message to all logged in chat and a private message to a specific logged in
Using a TCP connection. Each client can initiate a request to download a file from the server using a parallel TCP connection
To the file transfer channel by UDP connection

# The client can perform the following actions:
1) Connect to the server,
2) Disconnect from the server,
3) Send a message to another customer,
4) Send a message to all clients currently connected to the server,
5) Get the names of the customers connected to the server,
6) Get a list of existing files on the server,
7) Send a request to download a file from the server,
